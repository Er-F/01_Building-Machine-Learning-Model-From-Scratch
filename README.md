# MachineLearning
The project1 notebook contains a self-built decision tree classifier, that was created as a part of an assignment in a machine learning course I did at university. When running everything, it also compares result to that of the classifier from the sklearn library. When comparing, It performed very closely with respect to prediction accuracy. However, my algorithm is much slower, so far from perfrect! (There are also some bar-charts that illustrates the differences) 


#NOTE: The pruning of the tree works, but is not an optimal solution.
