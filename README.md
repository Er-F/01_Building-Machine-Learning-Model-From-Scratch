# MachineLearning
The project1 notebook is a self-built decision tree classifier, that was created as a part of an assignment in a machine learning course at the University of Bergen.
The classifier was compared to that of the scikit-learn library, and it performed very closely with respect to prediction accuracy. However, my algorithm is much slower, so far from perfrect :)  


#NOTE: The pruning of the tree works, but is not an optimal solution.
